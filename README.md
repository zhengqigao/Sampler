# Sampling Methods Library

This library is dedicated to providing a comprehensive collection of sampling methods, encompassing classical sampling techniques (such as importance sampling and rejection sampling), deep learning-based samplers, and rare event samplers. It is designed with PyTorch data formats in mind for seamless integration into modern machine learning workflows.

## Features

- **Classical Sampling Methods**: Implementations of traditional sampling algorithms that are foundational to statistical computing and Monte Carlo methods.
- **Deep Learning-Based Samplers**: Leverage the power of deep learning to create efficient and adaptable sampling mechanisms.
- **Rare Event Samplers**: Specialized techniques for efficiently sampling rare events, crucial for risk assessment and anomaly detection in various domains.
